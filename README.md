# Drone

# [Milfist][0] Drone

## Description

A simple driver for a drone has been developed (vehicle
unmanned aerial). With this device you want to fly over a set
of urbanizations (defined by an identifier) with the objective of
know how many chalets have a pool.
The mapping team will indicate the idealist development team i + d
coordinates and a range to fly over (whole number representing
an area with a certain size), but the drone can only be
Provide a collection of urbanizations to visit.

### What will I find?

It is an example application in **Java 9**. It has continuous integration with **Travis CI**, report of unit test coverage and is integrated with **CodeClimate**, **Sonarcloud** and **Codecov**.

### What I can do?

* <code>*mvn test*</code>: Execute the unit tests and generate the coverage report.
* <code>*mvn verify -P integration-test*</code>: Execute the integration test.
* <code>*mvn site*</code>: Generate Javadoc documentation.

### Last news

###### 19-04-2018 I have managed to configure the **CodeClimate coverage**! I will create a separate repository for this configuration, which is quite complex and there is very little information.
###### 20-04-2018 Starting modularization
