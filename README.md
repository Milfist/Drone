# Drone

# [Milfist][0] Drone

## Description

A simple driver for a drone has been developed (vehicle
unmanned aerial). With this device you want to fly over a set
of urbanizations (defined by an identifier) ​​with the objective of
know how many chalets have a pool.
The mapping team will indicate the idealist development team i + d
coordinates and a range to fly over (whole number representing
an area with a certain size), but the drone can only be
Provide a collection of urbanizations to visit.

### What will I find?

It is an example application in **Java 9**. It has continuous integration with **Travis CI**, report of unit test coverage and is integrated with **CodeClimate**.

### Attention!

The implementation of **getUrbanizationId()** and **getAdjacent()** is just a mock. The important thing is **getUrbanizations()** that are part of a larger program.
