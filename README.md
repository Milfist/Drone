## Description

A simple driver for a drone has been developed (vehicle
unmanned aerial). With this device you want to fly over a set

know how many chalets have a pool.
The mapping team will indicate the idealist development team i + d
coordinates and a range to fly over (whole number representing
an area with a certain size), but the drone can only be
Provide a collection of urbanizations to visit.

### What will I find?

It is an example application in **Java 9**. It has continuous integration with **Travis CI**, report of unit test coverage and is integrated with **CodeClimate** and **Sonarcloud**.

### What I can do?

* <code>*mvn test*</code>: Execute the unit tests and generate the coverage report.
* <code>*mvn verify -P integration-test*</code>: Execute the integration test.
* <code>*mvn site*</code>: Generate Javadoc documentation.
